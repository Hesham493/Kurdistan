The city was later conquered by the Assyrians.Erbil became an integral part of the kingdom of Assyria by the 15st century BC through to the end of the seventh century BC, after it was captured by the Gutians, and it was known in Assyrian annals variously as Urbilim, Arbela and Arba-ilu. Subsequent to this, it was part of the geopolitical province of Assyria under several empires in turn, including the Median Empire, the Achaemenid Empire (Achaemenid Assyria), Macedonian Empire, Seleucid Empire, Armenian Empire, Parthian Empire, Roman Assyria and, as well as being the capital of the tributary state of Adiabene between the mid-second century BC and early second century AD.</p>
